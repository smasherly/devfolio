I've been using Tailwind for the past four months. At first, I didn't get it. The code looked messy and there were classes everywhere—it was a real struggle.

Then I wrote this:

```js
const Spinner = () => (
  <div className="w-4 h-4 border-2 border-gray-300 border-t-gray-600 rounded-full animate-spin ml-2" />
);
```

Then I built a simple spinner using just Tailwind classes—no extra library, no digging through countless class names. And just like that—it clicked. I realized how versatile and time-saving Tailwind can be.

Now I know why people dig it.
